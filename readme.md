# Kudo's to IAmElement for this script checker, as we find more malware in Lua, we will add to this bat file. 

- MalScanner.bat aims to check all of your servers resources for Malware.

# About
This is a specific study into a common pay-hack providers methodology.
Credit goes to the specific individuals which devoted a lot of time to discover this growing problem on FiveM, their identities are redacted.

# Analysis
Most FiveM malware is formed around Remote Execution/Administration Tool (RAT). 4 lines of Lua code are written into resources (many of them obfuscate the code) which will download remote code from the external servers. We've found many leaked resources are infected with this type of malware. This repository will talk more about how it works works.

# How it works
It works by individuals releasing infected code/resources to the FiveM public. Server owners/developers take the code (that they don't know is infected) and install it on their servers. Once the resource is installed and ran it will inject its code into other previously clean resources.
